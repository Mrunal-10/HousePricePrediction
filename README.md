What's Inside?

 1. Understanding the Data
We start by importing the dataset (`HousingData.csv`) using Pandas. You'll get a glimpse of the data by checking out its first few rows and understanding its structure.

 2. Preparing the Data
Data preprocessing is crucial for building a reliable model. We handle missing values using forward and backward fill methods and encode categorical data to numerical values.

 3. Exploring the Data
Visualizing data helps us grasp insights more effectively. You'll visualize the distribution of house prices using histograms, providing a clearer understanding of the data distribution.

 4. Building and Training the Model
Now, it's time to dive into machine learning! We split the dataset into training and testing sets and train a Linear Regression model. You'll learn how to evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error and mean absolute error.
